# Banking-System

📖 Project Description

The Banking System is a menu-driven C++ console application that simulates basic banking operations.
It allows users to create accounts, deposit money, withdraw funds, transfer money, and check balances — all using core C++ concepts.
This project was built as part of my C++ internship project, strictly using basic concepts without file handling, as per learning constraints.

📍 The Process
I approached this project by first analyzing how basic banking operations work in real life. I then mapped those operations into a menu-driven C++ program using object-oriented principles. The development started with account creation, followed by core features like deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiry, and fund transfers. Each feature was implemented incrementally, ensuring smooth program flow and logical consistency. This project helped me gain confidence in applying OOP concepts and building a complete system using only foundational C++ knowledge.
